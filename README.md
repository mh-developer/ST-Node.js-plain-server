# Node.js plain server

## Main idea

Idea is to create Node.js server from scratch. Implement support for different MIME types, make them available to serve.

## System architecture

In this experiment I used following technologies:
- Node.js without any external libraries or frameworks

## Installation and running

So you need first to clone this repo.

You can locally run app with the following commands:

1. `npm start`

Then you can open app in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`.

On the entry path we are display welcome message. Other availables subpaths are:
- `/funkcionalnosti-odjemalca`
- `/posebnosti`
- `/use-case.png`
